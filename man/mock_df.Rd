\title{Generate data frame with treatment and response random variable}
\usage{
mock_df(
  distribution = "normal",
  ntrts,
  n,
  mean = NULL,
  sd = NULL,
  max_trt_eff = 0,
  size = NULL,
  prob = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{The distribution from which to generate the random
variable. Options are "normal", "poisson", "logistic", or "negbin".}

\item{ntrts}{The number of treatments (including control).}

\item{n}{The number of observations per treatment group.}

\item{mean}{The mean of the response random variable for the control group.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the response random variable (for normal distribution).}

\item{max_trt_eff}{The maximum treatment effect (difference from control).}

\item{size}{The target number of successful trials (for negative binomial and logistic).}

\item{prob}{Probability of success (for negative binomial and logistic).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns 'treatment' and 'y'
}
\description{
Creates a data frame with a treatment factor and response variable for
use in simulation studies. The function generates data for a control group and
multiple treatment groups with specified effects.
