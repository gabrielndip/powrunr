\usage{
anova_runr(
  num_sim,
  n,
  mean,
  sd,
  max_trt_eff,
  ntrts,
  distribution = "normal",
  prob = NULL,
  size = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_sim}{Number of simulations to perform.}

\item{n}{The number of observations per treatment group.}

\item{mean}{The mean of the response random variable for the control group.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the response random variable (for normal distribution).}

\item{max_trt_eff}{The maximum treatment effect (difference from control).}

\item{ntrts}{The number of treatments (including control).}

\item{distribution}{The distribution from which to generate the random
variable. Options are "normal", "poisson", "logistic", or "negbin".}

\item{prob}{Probability of success (for negative binomial and logistic).}

\item{size}{The target number of successful trials (for negative binomial and logistic).}
}
\value{
A data frame of contrasts with p-values from post-hoc tests.
}
\description{
Runs simulations to estimate the statistical power of ANOVA tests for
detecting differences between treatment groups. The function generates
data from a specified distribution, performs ANOVA analysis, and returns
the results of post-hoc tests.

# Simple example with 5 simulations

# Calculate power by summarizing results
sims <- anova_runr(num_sim = 20, n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 15, max_trt_eff = 20, ntrts = 3)
power <- mean(sims$p.value < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
